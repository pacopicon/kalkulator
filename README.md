Description of Kalkulator project:

Kalkulator... 

1 - performs multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, modulo, square root, exponentiation.
2 - will store (S) whatever is inputed and retrieve (R) to allow for more complex calculations
3 - manages input state via Redux.  Some components have local states in order to do local operations such as toggling the '(' character to ')'
4 - handles prohibited inputs via user-directed error messages that avoid app crashes.
5 - does not hide number inputs when inputting an operator; instead additional number or operator inputs are accumulated into same input.
6 - handles both keyboard and number pad inputs.
